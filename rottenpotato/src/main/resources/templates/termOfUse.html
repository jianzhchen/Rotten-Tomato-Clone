When we say "Services" or "Site" in these Terms, we mean websites operating under the Fandango, FandangoNOW, Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster, Movieclips, Movies.com, Activaterewards.com, Fandango FanShop, or M-GO brands or other brands that we own, as well as those of our websites, applications, emails and other communications that link to or reference these Terms or other Terms and Policies, or the other services provided through any of these means. These Terms are subject to, and shall also include, the other Terms and Policies.
                </p>
                <h3>
                NOTICE OF ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:
                </h3>
                <p>
                Your use of the Services is subject to binding individual arbitration of any disputes which may arise, as provided below and in our Terms and Policies. Please read the arbitration provisions carefully and do not use the Services if you are unwilling to arbitrate any disputes you may have with us as provided below.
                </p>

                <h4 class="title">1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>
                <p>
                These Terms of Use set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services. By using the Services, you agree that you have read, understand and agree to be legally bound by these Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                Fandango may, subject to the below, change these Terms from time to time on a prospective basis, and modify, add or discontinue any aspect, content or feature of the Services, at its sole discretion. Your continued use or accessing of the Services following the posting of any changes to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to these Terms would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid these Terms being deemed illusory or unenforceable.
                </p>
                <p>
                Any form of transfer or sublicense, or unauthorized access, distribution, reproduction, copying, retransmission, publication, sale, or exploitation (commercial or otherwise), of any portion of the Services, including but not limited to all content, services, digital products, tools or products, is hereby expressly prohibited.

                <h4 class="title" >4. PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision, all of which will remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law which establishes a different statute of limitations, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, any claim or cause of action (including any arbitration) arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services, or these Terms, our Privacy Policy, our Terms and Policies, or other Fandango Transactions or Relationships must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The paragraph or section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms represent the entire understanding of the parties regarding its subject matter, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings between the parties regarding its subject matter, and may not be amended, altered or waived except in writing by the party to be charged.
